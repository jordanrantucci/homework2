# Homework2 Responsive Portfolio

## Description 

This project was intended to combine our knowledge of HTML and CSS and our ability to link multiple HTML pages.  The project includes taking styling from bootstrap and applying
it to your code to personalize your portfolio page.  This project demonstrates the ability to add custom fonts as well as using pseudo class to add to the styling.  My page also
shows the ability to make a responsive webpage using Media Queries to allow for your page to adapt and function properly on smaller screens.  The project also shows the ability to properly utilize bootstrap components as well as the grid system.

To make this site accessible, the acceptance criteria needed to be met were the following.

  Using Bootstrap, develop a portfolio with the following items:
* A navbar
* A Responsive Layout
* Responsive Images

The Bootstrap portfolio should minimze the use of media queries.  The website must be a functional deployed application.  The GitHub repository must contain a README describing the project.  The Navbar must be consistent on each page and have the ability to link to the Home/About, Contact and Portfolio pages.  All links must work and semantic html must be used. Each page must have valid and correct HTML and contain personal information and links to social media.
